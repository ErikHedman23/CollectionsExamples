Collection classes are organized into namespaces and contain built in methods for processing elements within the collection.
// A collection organizes data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
//Dictionaries are used to represent conections on social websites (like Facebook), queues can be used to create task schedulers, HashSets are used in searching algorithms.
//A collection typically includes methods to add, remove, and count objects.
//the for and foreach statements are used to iterate through collections.

//Generic Collections -- Only desired data types can be added to a generic collection
